I am currently a visiting scholar at [Data & Language Intelligence (DLI) Lab](https://diyonsei.notion.site/) at Yonsei University.
Here, I finished my Ph.D. thesis and am expected to receive Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at [POSTECH](https://cse.postech.ac.kr/), under the supervision of [Prof. Hwanjo Yu](http://di.postech.ac.kr/hwanjoyu).

During my Ph.D., I was fortunate to join [Scatter Lab](https://www.scatterlab.co.kr/) and contribute to the development of *Luda Lee*, a social companion chatbot, and *Zeta*, an AI storytelling platform, both of which serve over one million users.

My research aims to develop human-friendly AI agents endowed with social intelligence.
Toward this goal, I have worked on multimodal agents, evaluation methods for social intelligence, and the construction of benchmarks and large-scale synthetic datasets to model desirable human-like behaviors.
